The consolidated patch for the required kernel modifications is in
sys_fail.patch.

Command to compile the test program:

gcc -static -I /usr/src/linux-2.6.11.12-hwk2/include -o test-fail test_fail.c

(or make HEADERS=/usr/src/linux-2.6.11.12-hwk2/include)

If the patched source is checked out in a different directory, then the include 
directory for that tree should be supplied in the HEADERS variable.

Then run with ./test-fail or 'make test'.
