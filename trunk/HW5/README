README for HW5, group 2 (Ben Warfield, Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Mengu Sukan)

Files in this package:
	README 	- This file.
	homework_work.txt	- In which we assert that this code is correct
	mru.patch	-	actual kernel patch file
	testing/Makefile	- Makefile for demonstration/test code	


To compile all test and demonstration code, run "make" in the testing
directory. The compiler will look for linux header files in 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.11.12$(TREE_TAG).  By default, $TREE_TAG is set to "-hwk4", 
but it can be changed on the command line, e.g.

	make test TREE_TAG='-group2'
	make test TREE_TAG=''

To swith between policies, use the two following programs. Of course, by default,
we use the normal (LRU) policy.
	
	set_cache_normal
	set_cache_mru

The program to run during tests is "swap_central", it creates a linked list (size
can be passed as a parameter) and runs through it a number of times (second
parameter). For instance:

	swap_central 150000 3


The two demo programs are:

	demo.sh
	vmdemo.sh

The first one ("demo.sh") launches swap_central with LRU policy, than MRU policy.
Execution time is reported.
The second one ("vmdemo.sh") does the same, but reports stats about pageins and
pageouts.
