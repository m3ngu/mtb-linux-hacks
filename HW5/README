README for HW5, group 2 (Ben Warfield, Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Mengu Sukan)

Files in this package:
	README 				- This file.
	homework_work.txt		- In which we assert that this code is correct
	mru.patch			- actual kernel patch file
	testing/Makefile		- Makefile for demonstration/test code	
	testing/set_cache_normal.c	- set cache to LRU
	testing/set_cache_mru.c		- set cache to MRU
	testing/swap_central.c		- creates linked list, goes through
	testing/demo.sh			- demo LRU vs MRU
	testing/vmdemo.sh		- demo LRU vs MRU, pageins/pageouts report
	

To compile all test and demonstration code, run "make" in the testing
directory. The compiler will look for linux header files in 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.11.12$(TREE_TAG).  By default, $TREE_TAG is set to "-hwk4", 
but it can be changed on the command line, e.g.

	make test TREE_TAG='-group2'
	make test TREE_TAG=''

To switch between policies, use the two following programs. Of course, by 
default, we use the normal (LRU) policy.
	
	set_cache_normal
	set_cache_mru

The program to run during tests is "swap-central", it creates a linked
list (size can be passed as a parameter) and runs through it a number of
times (second parameter). For instance:

	swap-central 150000 3


The two demo programs are:

	demo.sh
	vmdemo.sh

The first one ("demo.sh") launches swap-central with LRU policy, then
MRU policy, and reports the execution time for each.  The second one
("vmdemo.sh") does the same, but also reports statistics about pageins
and pageouts (at 5-second intervals throughout the execution of each run
of the program).
