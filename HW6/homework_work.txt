   We certify that:
     * The code submitted here compiles properly and runs without
       crashing.
     * While we may have discussed the assignment with others, the code
       submitted is entirely our own group's work and no other student 
       has edited it.
     * So far as we have been able to determine, the program properly
       handles all reasonable inputs.

   Further instructions to the student: 
     * Check your code to make sure it is readable. You may wish to
       add some comments, change a variable name, or even restructure the
       code. This also often helps you find bugs in the code.

     * Print your code out and make sure that all the lines fit on the
       page without wrapping.
     * Include this file with the files you submit for your
       programming assignment.  The file should be named "homework_work.txt".
     * Describe below how each member of your group contributed to the
       assignment.  Include a list of C functions and files that you modified
       or implemented and which group member was primarily responsible
       for doing each.  All group members are expected to contribute in
       writing the code for each assignment.
