README for HW3, group 2 (Ben Warfield, Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Mengu Sukan)

Files in this package:
	homework_work.txt	- In which we assert that this code is correct
	barrier.patch	-	actual kernel patch file
	barrier_testing/barrier_test.c	- demonstration/test file for barriers
	barrier_testing/Makefile	- Makefile for barrier demonstration/tests
	sthreads/Makefile 	- Makefile for sthreads component
	sthreads/sthread.c	- sthreads main source (unmodified)
	sthreads/sthread.h	- sthreads header file (unmodified)
	sthreads/sync.c   	- semaphore implementation file (main file for part 1.)
	sthreads/sync.h   	- semaphore header file (declarations, struct def'n)
	sthreads/test.c   	- test/demonstration code for semaphores

To run barrier demonstration code, run "make test" in the barrier_testing 
directory.  The compiler will look for linux header files in 
/usr/src/linux-2.6.11.12$(TREE_TAG).  By default, $TREE_TAG is set to "-hwk3", 
but it can be changed on the command line, e.g.

	make test TREE_TAG='-group2'
	make test TREE_TAG=''

To run sthreads demonstration code, run "make test" in the sthreads directory.
